My plan for dev_1 is to continue working on my budget planner program I started in dev_0. I plan to make use of as much of the JavaScript coding tools we've recently learned as possible in order to tighten up the structure of the program, add user interactive elements and CRUD features, and display the results nicely in an HTML table layout instead of blocks of text. I want this to be as versatile and customizable as I can make it. I believe I have a good algorithmic/calculation base in the program as it stands, so everything else is just going to be creating, formatting, and connecting the various GUI components, and the logic operations that need to be done to allow those to function properly within the context of the program. I would love for this to hopefully become useful enough beyond being just a class project, that it ends up being something that gets some real-world use.
